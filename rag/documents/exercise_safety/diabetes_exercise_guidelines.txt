Exercise Safety Guidelines for People with Diabetes (ADA 2024)

When NOT to Exercise:

Blood glucose too low:
- Below 70 mg/dL: Treat hypoglycemia first, wait until above 90 mg/dL
- 70-90 mg/dL: Eat 15g carbs, wait 15 minutes, recheck before exercising

Blood glucose too high:
- Above 250 mg/dL WITH ketones: Do NOT exercise (risk of DKA)
- Above 300 mg/dL even without ketones: Avoid vigorous exercise
- 250-300 mg/dL: Only light activity, stay hydrated

Pre-Exercise Glucose Targets:
- Ideal range: 90-150 mg/dL
- If 90-124 mg/dL: May need small snack for exercise >30 min
- If 125-180 mg/dL: Safe to exercise
- If >250 mg/dL: Wait and recheck

Exercise Recommendations:

Frequency:
- At least 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity
- Spread over at least 3 days/week
- No more than 2 consecutive days without activity

Types:
- Aerobic: Walking, cycling, swimming (improves insulin sensitivity)
- Resistance: 2-3 times/week (increases muscle glucose uptake)
- Flexibility: Daily if possible
- Balance training: For older adults

Timing:
- Best: 1-2 hours after meals (reduces postprandial spike)
- Avoid: Fasting exercise if prone to hypoglycemia
- Evening exercise: Check glucose before bed (risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia)

Hydration:
- Drink water before, during, and after
- Dehydration raises blood glucose
- Aim: 8oz before, 4-8oz every 15-20 minutes during

Monitoring:
- Check glucose before exercise
- For sessions >60 min: Check during exercise
- Always check after exercise
- Recheck 2-4 hours after (delayed hypoglycemia risk)

Signs to STOP exercising:
- Feeling shaky, confused, dizzy
- Chest pain or pressure
- Severe shortness of breath
- Visual changes
- Extreme fatigue

Medication Adjustments:
- Insulin users: May need to reduce dose before exercise
- Timing matters: Exercise during peak insulin action increases hypo risk
- Consult healthcare provider for personalized plan

Carb Recommendations During Exercise:
- <30 min moderate: Usually no extra carbs needed
- 30-60 min moderate: 0-15g carbs
- >60 min moderate: 15-30g carbs per hour
- High intensity: May need 30-60g carbs per hour

Post-Exercise:
- Glucose may drop for 24 hours after exercise
- Higher risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia
- May need bedtime snack
- Monitor more frequently
