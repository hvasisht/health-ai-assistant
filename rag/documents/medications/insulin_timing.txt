Insulin Types and Timing Guide

Rapid-Acting Insulin:
Examples: Humalog, Novolog, Apidra
- Onset: 10-15 minutes
- Peak: 1-2 hours
- Duration: 3-5 hours
- Timing: Take 0-15 minutes before meals
- Best for: Covering meals, correcting high glucose

Short-Acting (Regular) Insulin:
Examples: Humulin R, Novolin R
- Onset: 30 minutes
- Peak: 2-4 hours
- Duration: 5-8 hours
- Timing: Take 30 minutes before meals

Intermediate-Acting Insulin:
Examples: NPH (Humulin N, Novolin N)
- Onset: 1-2 hours
- Peak: 4-8 hours
- Duration: 12-18 hours
- Timing: Usually twice daily

Long-Acting Insulin:
Examples: Lantus, Levemir, Basaglar
- Onset: 1-2 hours
- Peak: Minimal peak
- Duration: 20-24 hours
- Timing: Once or twice daily, same time each day

Ultra-Long-Acting:
Examples: Tresiba, Toujeo
- Onset: 1-2 hours
- Peak: No pronounced peak
- Duration: 36-42 hours
- Timing: Once daily, flexible timing

Meal Timing with Insulin:

Rapid-acting:
- Inject 0-15 min before eating
- Can inject during meal if uncertain about eating
- Post-meal injection: Only if forgot, increases spike risk

Regular insulin:
- MUST inject 30 minutes before eating
- Don't wait longer than 45 minutes to eat after injection
- Risk of hypoglycemia if meal delayed

Exercise Considerations:
- Exercise during insulin peak: Highest hypo risk
- Rapid-acting peak: 1-2 hours after injection
- Avoid exercise during this window if glucose <120 mg/dL
- Long-acting: Provides steady background, safe to exercise

Storage:
- Unopened: Refrigerate
- In-use: Room temperature okay for 28 days
- Never freeze
- Avoid extreme heat (>86°F/30°C)

Rotation Sites:
- Abdomen (fastest absorption)
- Arms (medium absorption)
- Thighs (slower absorption)
- Buttocks (slower absorption)
- Rotate sites to prevent lipohypertrophy

Warning Signs:
- Cloudy insulin (should be clear except NPH)
- Clumps or crystals
- Color change
- Expired = discard
