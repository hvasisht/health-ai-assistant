ADA 2024 Glucose Target Guidelines

For adults with diabetes (non-pregnant):

Before meals (preprandial): 80-130 mg/dL
Peak postprandial (1-2 hours after beginning of meal): Less than 180 mg/dL

A1C targets:
- General goal: Less than 7%
- More stringent (if achievable without hypoglycemia): Less than 6.5%
- Less stringent (history of hypoglycemia, limited life expectancy): Less than 8%

Hypoglycemia Thresholds:
- Level 1 (Alert): 70 mg/dL and below
- Level 2 (Serious): Below 54 mg/dL
- Level 3 (Severe): Cognitive impairment requiring assistance

Continuous Glucose Monitoring Goals:
- Time in range (70-180 mg/dL): Greater than 70%
- Time below range (<70 mg/dL): Less than 4%
- Time above range (>180 mg/dL): Less than 25%
