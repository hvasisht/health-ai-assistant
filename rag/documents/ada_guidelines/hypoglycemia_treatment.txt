Hypoglycemia Treatment Protocol (ADA 2024)

Rule of 15:
1. Consume 15 grams of fast-acting carbohydrates
2. Wait 15 minutes
3. Recheck blood glucose
4. If still below 70 mg/dL, repeat

Fast-acting carbohydrate options (15g):
- 4 glucose tablets
- 1 tube of glucose gel
- 4 ounces (1/2 cup) of fruit juice
- 4 ounces (1/2 cup) of regular soda (not diet)
- 1 tablespoon of sugar, honey, or corn syrup
- 8 ounces of nonfat or 1% milk

Do NOT use:
- Chocolate (fat slows absorption)
- Foods with fat (ice cream, cookies)
- Complex carbohydrates alone

After recovery:
- Eat a small snack with protein if next meal is more than 1 hour away
- Examples: crackers with cheese, half sandwich, yogurt

Severe hypoglycemia:
- If unconscious or unable to swallow: Glucagon injection
- Call 911 if no improvement within 15 minutes of glucagon
